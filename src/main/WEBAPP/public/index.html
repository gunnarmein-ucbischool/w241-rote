            <br>
            Thank you for taking the time to help us today. Relax, nobody will judge you on the results, we will never know who you are, 
            and we ask very little personal information from you (such as your age and gender). The more you can tell us, the more meaning our
            research will have.<br> 
            <br>
            For the actual exercise, you will memorize answers to a total of two topics, in two sections of two. The experience will vary from
            person to person, that is by design. There is a time limit, don't stress out over it, just do your best. 
            <br>
            In our survey, going back doesn't really work. We do little to prevent it, but just keep going forward. If you make a mistake,
            don't worry about it, we have all done it. <br>
            <br>
            Similarly, please take this survey only once. If a family member or friend wants to take the test on you computer, please
            open a new browser window. 
            <br>
            Lastly, we have a big favor to ask: It would be easy to cheat on this little task and test. Please don't. Our object is too establish
            whether something we present to you makes a difference, and if you cheat, we won't really learn anything. Thank you!<br>
