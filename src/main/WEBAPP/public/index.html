            <br>
            Thank you for taking the time to help us today. This is an anonymous survey, we will never know who you are.<br> 
            <br>
            In this exercise, you will memorize answers to a total of 4 topics divided to part 1 and part 2. Please keep these in mind during the exercise:
            <br>
            1. This is not accessing your performance. Please complete this individually, we will share the results with you after August 12.
            <br>
            2. There is a time limit, don't stress out over it, just do your best.
            <br>
            3. Do not take notes unless instructed. 
            <br>
            4. Keep going forward, once “go back” button is hit the results will be disqualified from the research.
            <br>
            5. Take this survey only once. If a family member or friend wants to take the test on your computer, please open a new browser window. 
            <br>
            In our survey, going back doesn't really work. We do little to prevent it, but just keep going forward. If you make a mistake,
            don't worry about it, we have all done it. <br>
            <br>
            Similarly, please take this survey only once. If a family member or friend wants to take the test on your computer, please
            open a new browser window. 
            <br>
            Hope you enjoy memorizing some fun facts. Thank you for your contribution to our research :)<br>
