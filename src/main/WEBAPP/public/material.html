            Hello Rote user!<br>
            <br>
            You have been assigned to control, but you won't know that.  <br>
            <br>
            The Fusor project is a 5-year effort to build an electrostatic inertial confinement fusion reactor at Eastside Preparatory School.
            Students under expert supervision have built a machine that uses high vacuum and high voltage to accelerate deuterium ions
            toward each other. When the ions collide with enough speed, they fuse into Helium-3 or Tritium, about 50% each. 
            In the tritium reaction, a neutron is released, allowing us to verify that nuclear fusion actually took place. With such
            experiments comes dangerous radiation in the form of x-rays and neutrons. Lead-shielding is deployed to deal with the x-rays,
            paraffin with its high hydrogen content serves as the neutron moderator. <br>
            <br>
            Over summer, the Fusor team has conducted extensive modeling efforts to gauge the effectiveness of imperfect neutron shielding.
            Simulations employ isotropic scattering (in which the cosine of the scattering angle is distributed uniformly). A major
            variable is missing from our simulations - it is impossible for us to forecast the neutron flux as there are simply too many
            variables involved. We can only predict the relative effectiveness of the shielding. <br>
            <br>
            From the above text, we would like you to remember the reasons we chose paraffin, the characteristics of isotropic scattering,
            and what we know about the level of neutron flux we will be dealing with. Read the text again with this in mind, but don't take
            notes, please. <br>
            <br>
