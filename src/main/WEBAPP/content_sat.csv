"The Civil War","The Civil War in Virginia (1862)

The Civil War in the United States began in 1861, after decades of simmering tensions between northern and southern states over slavery, states’ rights and westward expansion. The election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 caused seven southern states to secede and form the Confederate States of America; four more states soon joined them. The War Between the States, as the Civil War was also known, ended in Confederate surrender in 1865. The conflict was the costliest and deadliest war ever fought on American soil, with some 620,000 of 2.4 million soldiers killed, millions more injured and much of the South left in ruin.
 
George B. McClellan–who replaced the aging General Winfield Scott as supreme commander of the Union Army after the first months of the war–was beloved by his troops, but his reluctance to advance frustrated Lincoln. In the spring of 1862, McClellan finally led his Army of the Potomac up the peninsula between the York and James Rivers, capturing Yorktown on May 4. The combined forces of Robert E. Lee and Jackson successfully drove back McClellan’s army in the Seven Days’ Battles (June 25-July 1), and a cautious McClellan called for yet more reinforcements in order to move against Richmond. Lincoln refused, and instead withdrew the Army of the Potomac to Washington. By mid-1862, McClellan had been replaced as Union general-in-chief by Henry W. Halleck, though he remained in command of the Army of the Potomac.
 
Lee then moved his troops northwards and split his men, sending Jackson to meet Pope’s forces near Manassas, while Lee himself moved separately with the second half of the army. On August 29, Union troops led by John Pope struck Jackson’s forces in the Second Battle of Bull Run (Second Manassas). The next day, Lee hit the Federal left flank with a massive assault, driving Pope’s men back towards Washington. On the heels of his victory at Manassas, Lee began the first Confederate invasion of the North. Despite contradictory orders from Lincoln and Halleck, McClellan was able to reorganize his army and strike at Lee on September 14 in Maryland, driving the Confederates back to a defensive position along Antietam Creek, near Sharpsburg.
 
On September 17, the Army of the Potomac hit Lee’s forces (reinforced by Jackson’s) in what became the war’s bloodiest single day of fighting. Total casualties at the Battle of Antietam (also known as the Battle of Sharpsburg) numbered 12,410 of some 69,000 troops on the Union side, and 13,724 of around 52,000 for the Confederates. The Union victory at Antietam would prove decisive, as it halted the Confederate advance in Maryland and forced Lee to retreat into Virginia. Still, McClellan’s failure to pursue his advantage earned him the scorn of Lincoln and Halleck, who removed him from command in favor of Ambrose E. Burnside. Burnside’s assault on Lee’s troops near Fredericksburg on December 13 ended in heavy Union casualties and a Confederate victory; he was promptly replaced by Joseph “Fighting Joe” Hooker, and both armies settled into winter quarters across the Rappahannock River from each other.
 
After the Emancipation Proclamation (1863-4)
 
Lincoln had used the occasion of the Union victory at Antietam to issue a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all enslaved people in the rebellious states after January 1, 1863. He justified his decision as a wartime measure, and did not go so far as to free the enslaved people in the border states loyal to the Union. Still, the Emancipation Proclamation deprived the Confederacy of the bulk of its labor forces and put international public opinion strongly on the Union side. Some 186,000 Black Civil War soldiers would join the Union Army by the time the war ended in 1865, and 38,000 lost their lives.
 
In the spring of 1863, Hooker’s plans for a Union offensive were thwarted by a surprise attack by the bulk of Lee’s forces on May 1, whereupon Hooker pulled his men back to Chancellorsville. The Confederates gained a costly victory in the Battle of Chancellorsville, suffering 13,000 casualties (around 22 percent of their troops); the Union lost 17,000 men (15 percent). Lee launched another invasion of the North in June, attacking Union forces commanded by General George Meade on July 1 near Gettysburg, in southern Pennsylvania. Over three days of fierce fighting, the Confederates were unable to push through the Union center, and suffered casualties of close to 60 percent.
 
Meade failed to counterattack, however, and Lee’s remaining forces were able to escape into Virginia, ending the last Confederate invasion of the North. Also in July 1863, Union forces under Ulysses S. Grant took Vicksburg (Mississippi) in the Siege of Vicksburg, a victory that would prove to be the turning point of the war in the western theater. After a Confederate victory at Chickamauga Creek, Georgia, just south of Chattanooga, Tennessee, in September, Lincoln expanded Grant’s command, and he led a reinforced Federal army (including two corps from the Army of the Potomac) to victory in the Battle of Chattanooga in late November.
 
Toward a Union Victory (1864-65)
 
In March 1864, Lincoln put Grant in supreme command of the Union armies, replacing Halleck. Leaving William Tecumseh Sherman in control in the West, Grant headed to Washington, where he led the Army of the Potomac towards Lee’s troops in northern Virginia. Despite heavy Union casualties in the Battle of the Wilderness and at Spotsylvania (both May 1864), at Cold Harbor (early June) and the key rail center of Petersburg (June), Grant pursued a strategy of attrition, putting Petersburg under siege for the next nine months.
 
Sherman outmaneuvered Confederate forces to take Atlanta by September, after which he and some 60,000 Union troops began the famous “March to the Sea,” devastating Georgia on the way to capturing Savannah on December 21. Columbia and Charleston, South Carolina, fell to Sherman’s men by mid-February, and Jefferson Davis belatedly handed over the supreme command to Lee, with the Confederate war effort on its last legs. Sherman pressed on through North Carolina, capturing Fayetteville, Bentonville, Goldsboro and Raleigh by mid-April.
 
Meanwhile, exhausted by the Union siege of Petersburg and Richmond, Lee’s forces made a last attempt at resistance, attacking and captured the Federal-controlled Fort Stedman on March 25. An immediate counterattack reversed the victory, however, and on the night of April 2-3 Lee’s forces evacuated Richmond. For most of the next week, Grant and Meade pursued the Confederates along the Appomattox River, finally exhausting their possibilities for escape. Grant accepted Lee’s surrender at Appomattox Court House on April 9. On the eve of victory, the Union lost its great leader: The actor and Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Lincoln at Ford’s Theatre in Washington on April 14. Sherman received Johnston’s surrender at Durham Station, North Carolina on April 26, effectively ending the Civil War.",1,Question - how many troops were on the Union side in the Battle of Antietam?,"15,420","12,410","13,800","9,480",None of the above,I don't remember,B

"The Baroque Period (1600-1750)","The Baroque period was anticipated before 1600, although that date remains as a convenient marker for the start of the period. It is a period of dramatic expression, of a vigorous, highly ornamented art. An era of absolute monarchies, each court had its own group of musicians, both vocal and instrumental.
The Doctrine of Affections of the Baroque relates to the portrayal of emotions through music. A recognized musical vocabulary expressed certain emotions. Within this overall context, composers used musical techniques to vividly describe the meaning of the words. Rising passages are found at words such as ""resurrection,"" ""heaven,"" etc. Descending passages were used for such phrases as ""to the depths"" and ""descended into hell.""
It was also a period of scientific discovery and reasoning. New findings in the sciences were vitally important to knowledge on the continent. Although we are usually concerned with Baroque music of the continent, it was during this period that the settlement of the New World began.
Rhythmic energy, coupled with a strong melodic thrust, makes performances of Baroque music appealing and satisfying to musicians, both amateur and professional.
Characteristics of Baroque choral music include:
1. Vertical structure rather than linear
2. Major-minor tonality established
3. Figured bass
4. Outer voice polarity—soprano melody over a figured bass
5. New counterpoint—subordinate to the harmony
6. Concertato style important
7. Terraced dynamics
8. Instruments influenced texture
9. Form determined by musical considerations
10. Doctrine of Affections
11. Virtuosity and improvisation are important elements
12. Steady pulsating rhythm—barlines introduced
Although 1600 is generally acknowledged as the beginning of the Baroque period, Renaissance characteristics are found long after that. The two styles, stile antico and stile moderno existed side by side, particularly in the early Baroque. Composers often wrote in both styles; consequently, a conductor must look beyond the name and dates of a composer to determine the style of the music.",1,"Based on the article, which of the following options contains a property that IS NOT characteristic of Baroque choral music?","Terraced dynamics, doctrine of affections, virtuosity and improvisation, outer voice polarity","Steady pulsating rhythm, doctrine of affections, new counterpoint, figured bass","Instruments influenced texture, form determined by musical considerations, major-minor tonality","Instruments influenced texture, staccato style, instruments influenced texture","New counterpoint, concertato style, instruments influenced texture, doctrine of affections",I don't remember,D

"What Is The OSI Model?","The Open Systems Interconnection Model breaks down network communication into seven layers. These layers are useful for identifying network issues.

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is a conceptual model created by the International Organization for Standardization which enables diverse communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. In plain English, the OSI provides a standard for different computer systems to be able to communicate with each other.

The OSI model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. It’s based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.


Each layer of the OSI model handles a specific job and communicates with the layers above and below itself. DDoS attacks target specific layers of a network connection; application layer attacks target layer 7 and protocol layer attacks target layers 3 and 4.

Why does the OSI model matter?

Although the modern Internet doesn’t strictly follow the OSI model (it more closely follows the simpler Internet protocol suite), the OSI model is still very useful for troubleshooting network problems. Whether it’s one person who can’t get their laptop on the Internet, or a web site being down for thousands of users, the OSI model can help to break down the problem and isolate the source of the trouble. If the problem can be narrowed down to one specific layer of the model, a lot of unnecessary work can be avoided.

What are the seven layers of the OSI model?

The seven abstraction layers of the OSI model can be defined as follows, from top to bottom:

7. The Application Layer

This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user. Software applications like web browsers and email clients rely on the application layer to initiate communications. But it should be made clear that client software applications are not part of the application layer; rather the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user. Application layer protocols include HTTP as well as SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is one of the protocols that enables email communications).


6. The Presentation Layer

This layer is primarily responsible for preparing data so that it can be used by the application layer; in other words, layer 6 makes the data presentable for applications to consume. The presentation layer is responsible for translation, encryption, and compression of data.

Two communicating devices communicating may be using different encoding methods, so layer 6 is responsible for translating incoming data into a syntax that the application layer of the receiving device can understand.

If the devices are communicating over an encrypted connection, layer 6 is responsible for adding the encryption on the sender’s end as well as decoding the encryption on the receiver's end so that it can present the application layer with unencrypted, readable data.

Finally the presentation layer is also responsible for compressing data it receives from the application layer before delivering it to layer 5. This helps improve the speed and efficiency of communication by minimizing the amount of data that will be transferred.


5. The Session Layer

This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices. The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session. The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources.

The session layer also synchronizes data transfer with checkpoints. For example, if a 100 megabyte file is being transferred, the session layer could set a checkpoint every 5 megabytes. In the case of a disconnect or a crash after 52 megabytes have been transferred, the session could be resumed from the last checkpoint, meaning only 50 more megabytes of data need to be transferred. Without the checkpoints, the entire transfer would have to begin again from scratch.


4. The Transport Layer

Layer 4 is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices. This includes taking data from the session layer and breaking it up into chunks called segments before sending it to layer 3. The transport layer on the receiving device is responsible for reassembling the segments into data the session layer can consume.

The transport layer is also responsible for flow control and error control. Flow control determines an optimal speed of transmission to ensure that a sender with a fast connection doesn’t overwhelm a receiver with a slow connection. The transport layer performs error control on the receiving end by ensuring that the data received is complete, and requesting a retransmission if it isn’t.


3. The Network Layer

The network layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary. The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called packets, on the sender’s device, and reassembling these packets on the receiving device. The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination; this is known as routing.


2. The Data Link Layer

The data link layer is very similar to the network layer, except the data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the SAME network. The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames. Like the network layer, the data link layer is also responsible for flow control and error control in intra-network communication (The transport layer only does flow control and error control for inter-network communications).

1. The Physical Layer

This layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches. This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.",1,Which 2 layers sit between the Application Layer and the Transport Layer?,"Presentation Layer, Session Layer","Data Link Layer, Presentation Layer","Transmission Layer, Network Layer","DataLink Layer, Physical Layer",None of the above,I don't remember,A

"Famous potions from Harry Potter","Amortentia
Amortentia is a love potion that does not create actual love, but gives the drinker a powerful obsession and infatuation with the giver of the potion. It is usually either forced upon someone or covertly given. 

Confusing Concoction
A Confusing Concoction causes the drinker to become confused, distracted[3] and sick. During potions in his third year in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Harry has to brew this potion but cannot manage to thicken it. Harry sees Severus Snape scribble something on a clipboard that ""looks suspiciously like a zero.""

Draught of Living Death
When a person drinks the Draught of Living Death, they go into a deep sleep so strong that they appear to be dead, hence the name. It is made from powdered root of asphodel which is added to an infusion of wormwood, and was first mentioned in Harry's first potions lesson with Snape in Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone.

Draught of Peace
The Draught of Peace provides personal comfort, calms anxiety and soothes agitation. In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Snape sets the potion as one of his lessons. It is a very difficult potion to make as the ingredients have to be added in a very specific order, the mixture has to be stirred exactly the right number of times, and the heat of the flames on which it is simmering has to be lowered to exactly the right level for the right number of minutes before the final ingredient is added.

Felix Felicis/Liquid Luck
Felix Felicis, more commonly known as Liquid Luck, grants whoever drinks it unusually good luck. The time span of this luck depends on the amount imbibed. 

Pepperup Potion
A Pepperup Potion is designed to improve health, relieve coughs and colds, though it does have one major side effect: it causes steam to dribble from the patient's ears for several hours afterward. It is also used to quickly elevate body temperature, as shown after the second task in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire and mentioned in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

Polyjuice Potion
The Polyjuice Potion allows the drinker to assume the appearance of someone else for an hour or more depending on the quantity. The potion only causes a physical and voice transformation of the drinker, but clothing is not affected. Its ingredients include fluxweed, knotgrass, lacewing flies, leeches, powdered Bicorn horn, and shredded Boomslang skin. The final component is a bit of the individual to be impersonated; strands of hair are most often used for this purpose.

Skele-Gro
Skele-Gro is a medicinal potion that can regrow missing or removed bones, though it tastes terrible and the process is very slow and extremely painful. In Chamber of Secrets, a bewitched Bludger breaks Harry's arm while he plays Quidditch, and Gilderoy Lockhart, the incompetent Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, accidentally removes his bones instead of mending them. As a result, Harry takes a dose of the potion and spends the night in the hospital wing.

Sleekeazy's Hair Potion
Sleekeazy's Hair Potion is a beauty treatment used by witches to smooth and straighten hair.

Veritaserum
Veritaserum is a very powerful truth potion. The name ""Veritaserum"" derives from the Latin word Veritas, meaning truth. Three drops of this potion are all that is needed to force anyone to respond to any question with the truth.",1,Which of the following is NOT a famous potion from the Harry Potter series mentioned in the previous article?,Draught of Peace,Draught of Living Death,Pepperup Potion,Polyjuice potion,None of the above,I don't remember,E

"Creation of Central Park","Before Central Park was created, the landscape along what is now the Park�s perimeter from West 82nd to West 89th Street was the site of Seneca Village, a community of predominantly African-Americans, many of whom owned property. By 1855, the village consisted of approximately 225 residents, made up of roughly two-thirds African-Americans, one-third Irish immigrants, and a small number of individuals of German descent.
Seneca Village began in 1825, by the mid-1850s, Seneca Village comprised 50 homes and three churches, as well as burial grounds, and a school for African-American students. Compared to other African-Americans living in New York, residents of Seneca Village seem to have been more stable and prosperous � by 1855, approximately half of them owned their own homes. With property ownership came other rights not commonly held by African-Americans in the City � namely, the right to vote. In 1821, New York State required African-American men to own at least $250 in property and hold residency for at least three years to be able to vote. Of the 100 black New Yorkers eligible to vote in 1845, 10 lived in Seneca Village.

During the early 1850s, the City began planning for a large municipal park to counter unhealthful urban conditions and provide space for recreation. In 1853, the New York State Legislature enacted a law that set aside 775 acres of land in Manhattan � from 59th to 106th Streets, between Fifth and Eighth Avenues � to create the country�s first major landscaped public park.

The City acquired the land through eminent domain, the law that allows the government to take private land for public use with compensation paid to the landowner. This was a common practice in the 19th century, and had been used to build Manhattan�s grid of streets decades earlier. There were roughly 1,600 inhabitants displaced throughout the area. Ultimately, all residents had to leave by the end of 1857.

"How money is made","Did you know how much work went into creating bills? It's likely more than you ever expected.
The ordinary paper that consumers use throughout their everyday life such as newspapers, books, cereal boxes, etc., is primarily made of wood pulp; however, United States currency paper is composed of 75 percent cotton and 25 percent linen. This is what gives the United States currency its distinct look, feel and durability. Bills over $1 have red and blue strands woven in for security purposes. Dollar bills do not have this feature.
The image of the dollar bill is engraved onto giant steel plates. All physical monetary production is overseen by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which has printing facilities in Washington, D.C. and Fort Worth, Texas.
These sheets of soft steel are then curved slightly and bolted onto a printing cylinder. Ink is added and then wiped off, leaving only ink in the engraved, recessed areas of the plate. Around three tons of special ink are used a day.
The special sheets of paper, together in massive rolls, are then fed through the machines as they rotate, exerting 20 tons of pressure from the top and the bottom. These machines can print around 8,000 sheets per hour.
Sheets of bills also pass through a state-of-the-art computer scanning process that also checks for inconsistencies. One-dollar bills are checked by a machine known as a Nota-Sav. Higher bills are checked by a different program, as they include more security features.
When complete, bills are packaged and shipped all over the country.",1,What is the United States currency paper is composed of,75% cotton and 25% linen,75% cotton and 25% wood pulp,75% cotton and 25% wool,75% cotton and 25% synthetic polymer,None of the above,I don't remember,
